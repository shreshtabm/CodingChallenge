# CodingChallenge

Deployment target : 9.1
Language : Swift
Device : iPhone 6/6s
3rd Party Api : Used for pie Chart

Note : 

AutoLayout is not used : "Was doing with AutoLayout but consumed lot of time, so left the idea of Autolayout"

Could not get the pie chart exactly as the view given in the challenge.

Some of the buttons do not look exactly the same as given in the challenge.

Loading the data from the api feels a bit laggy, so please wait for few seconds after making the call (Maybe I am facing it because of the slow Internet here)

Have not checked call option in the device but have coded it.

The email option is a bit buggy.

The switch button for extra is a bit buggy.

Time taken to implement : 9 hours
